Scruffy (John Dough)

Description:
Scruffy is around 50 years old and homeless for at least 20 of those years. 5'11, somehow athletic for his age and, as his name implies, not very careful with his haircut or facial hair in general. Besides his looks, he always remains clean and not smelly. In Seattle, one in for people will think he is a hipster, not a homeless person. His messy hair was black one day, now is 97% gray. His eyes are dark, and he rarely looks someone in the eyes when talking to them. In reality, he rarely talks to anyone regardless of the situation, preferring to be unnoticed as much as possible.

History:
Before being Scruffy, he was known as soldier Dough, John Dought ((pronounced Dawght)). He was married to his lovely wife Jane and was raising his 3 years old son Paul. The Dough family had, until that tragic Sunday morning, a very uneventful and mundane life. John was deployed in some god-forgotten place with his platoon. Patrolling desert strands of land, fighting some rebels he had no idea why. The operation was classified, so the news of his wife's accident arrived to him three weeks later, when he was ready to fly back home.
The moment he open the letter will be imprinted forever in John's mind. No one prepared him for the news. He was expecting some update about his time-off, or maybe a transfer. The letter was pity and ruthless. Some in the lines of:
"Dear Mr Dough, it is with regret that the army informs you of a terrible accident, involving your wife and son. Haven't your deployment been classified, you would have being told immediately, but giving the circumstances of your mission, this course of action was necessary.
Rest assure that the army will take good care of you in this period of mourning for your loved ones, and will extend all the professional assistance to provide conform and help you cope with this devastating tragedy.
Please proceed immediately to your superior's officer for further instructions."
The further instructions were very simple: We (the army) are sorry. Please pack your things, you leave first thing tomorrow. Yes, we will need the letter back, it is classified material. No, I have no more information about what happened.
John, still in shock, flew back home. He tried to get any small piece of information available on the internet. He confirmed that a car accident involving his wife and son had killed both. The other driver was in critical state, in a hospital. Something about a drunk driver causing the accident, but not a lot of details.
Upon arrival, after three full days traveling (the army don't have any need to book you direct flights), jet legged and sleep deprived, he when straight to the hospital. His mind was not working properly since reading the letter. The only thing in his thoughts was: justice! It was surprisingly easy to find the hospital and the room of the patient he was looking for. John's memory is a blur, be he is certain of some things.
1 - The other driver was still in a bad state. Maybe a coma, maybe just sleeping.
2 - He killed the poor man (but doesn't know exactly how).
3 - No one noticed him.
4 - His brain started working again about 2 days later, after a terrible and long sleep.

Still very distressed with the happenings, John saw on the news that "the poor victim of a car accident" days ago had died in the hospital. There was a short video of what appeared to be the original newscast: the sheriff, explaining how a drunk driver cause the death or herself, her son and the other driver. His wife was the one drunk!
John's brain shut off once more.
Next think he remembers was about 6 months later, already in Seattle. He had traveled 5 states and many cities since the day his life ended. His faithful van - Rusty - was starting to show signals of problems, was full of trash and turned into a burden, instead of providing transportation and shelter. This day was John "awakening". He decided to organize, clean and fix Rusty, take better care of himself (hygiene wise) and wait for his death. Seattle seemed to him a good place to do this.
 
Family:
Jane and Paul (Paul was 3 when he died).
John cut all his contact with his and his wife family after her death.

TL;DR
Soldier, wife and kid died when he was deployed about 20 years ago. Freaked out and killed the other driver (guy was innocent after all). Second freak-out. Cut contact with family. Got in his van and wondered aimlessly for 6 months. Ended up in Seattle and decided to be cleaner and wait for his time.
