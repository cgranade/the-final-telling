Zoe had a normal life, a normal family.
She is an only child of two white women tech professionals. They raised her with high expectations and access to every tech camp imaginable. She never really cared for that though, even though she would humor her moms.
She matured before many other kids in her grade, and was teased relentlessly while trying to program about her body (or people joking about how easy she was).
As she grew up, she saw how society treated women ( mid stages of Trump presidency) and didn't want to see that happen to her moms or her. So she decided that she could address this by becoming a lawyer and taking down anyone who would enact violence based on gender, race, etc.

In law school, this got more personal when her roommate was brutally assaulted by a very wealthy donor at a school fundraiser when she was trying to run interference for you to get away.
Zoe tried to call the police but campus police wouldn't forward the call because of who the donor was. The system was broken. She had to tear down the system and become the new to fix this world.
She will rule this city by making it go through her as DA.

She currently is just starting to climb those ladders in Seattle's criminal justice world, as an assistant to the assistant to the assistant DA.
She commutes to her downtown office via the light rail stop near her modest apartment north of Northgate.
Thanks to law school she can handle her liquor and right now is super into agave tequilas.
