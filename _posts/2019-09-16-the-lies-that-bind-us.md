## Episode Summaries ##

### Episode 1 ###

What I wrought upon this world, I did for every admirable reason the world provided. What I did, I was celebrated and decorated for. Every news channel, paper, blog, and immer sings songs to my misdeeds. Books record the glory of the evils I unleashed. What meaning does "evil" even hold for us when all of our tales celebrate the worst of our cruelty towards each other, the most basic of our violent impulses?

The world is a convenient excuse, but I have chosen my own path through it. I have battled, but never fought. I have warred, but never struggled. I have laid waste and salted the earth behind me, without ever stopping to plant the seeds of a better world. What a terrifying thing, a better world, for any world worth living in would have surely judged and hanged any who committed half of my crimes.

They came at us from nowhere, from everywhere. Our lenses were filled with hostile pings, a goddamned sea of red coming right at us. Their fucking IED already got Buster the day before, so were all on alert anyway â€” of course we shot. We shot and shot and shot, killed every one of those \[REDACTED\] coming for us. You sit there taking notes, like you would have done a fucking thing different. Do you even have a clue what it's like? In the time it take for you to click your goddamned pen, they can end you if you don't pull that damn trigger. You weren't fucking there, we were.
