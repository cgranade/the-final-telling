## Episode Summaries ##

### Episode 1 ###

What secrets hide in the dreams of a dead city that has yet to note its own demise? What dread do we bury under layers of waking nightmares, beneath more tractable and familiar horrors? What misdeeds do we ignore in the sunlight while we live in the shade afforded by the profane landscapes of steel and glass that surrounds, embraces, and suffocates us? Today, we begin to lay all bare, for the die is cast. What is seen will not be unseen.

### Epsiode 3 : The Golden Magician's Wand ###

There is an order to this world, a system. All rise in power in accordance with this system, and all fall in equal accord and in due time.
Kings, emperors, popes, presidents, ministers, CEOs, all fall from their lofty heights.
Brick by brick we rise, only to fall to the poisons of our respective days.
We are the new monarchs of this age, absolute in our sovereignty over this doomed world, and we will fail as surely as every in our lineage.
This is the way, the order, the system of the world, and we will not change it --- we will merely perish trying.

**Played**: 2 September 2019

This episode opens with some definitely _not_ planning a stake-out the next day of the newly located Obelisk headquarters (borealis building) by definitely _not_ Scruffy and Margo. 
Chris was _not_ waiting to find out if Vincent or Tycha left the building to follow them. Zoe _was_ planning on doing her actual job for once.

In the morning the stake-out commences and Vincent and Tycha are seen entering the building by Scruffy in disguise "writing his novel" in a green notebook lent to him by Margo. 
Margo took her exam that morning and ... probably should spend more time studying and not hanging our with some random and occasionally attractive strangers. 
Scruffy after a few hours makes eye contact with someone briefly who then enters the building with Obelisk's offices, and for fear of being found he leaves to a more remote vantage point.
Margo moves in and while watching the building entrance, she sees someone leaving the building rapidly, but not from the actual building exit.

Separately, Zoe was doing her job that morning by looking into Tycha's background (clean) and getting the cops to bring in and question Tycha and Vincent. 
However, a call just shortly after lunch communicated that was not going to be an option as Vincent and Tycha were **MURDERED**.
This call from Detective Neil Paul (homicide) was productive and he asked her if she could come down to the scene to ID the bodies and see if there were any clues that would connect the two cases.
When there, Zoe catches Neil up on the details of her case and they go up into the building to see both people shot once in the head slumped in a meeting room while seated at the conference table.
Zoe, who should have went to cop school, notices some scuffed carpet near the victims and that the bodies had their pockets emptied.
After showing the cops this, a uniform finds vincent's wallet with nothing apparently missing in a trash bin outside.
Zoe then walked around the office looking for clues to her case, and found a safe embedded in Vincent's desk.
She then with her budding larceny skills manages to get it open and put the contents in her pocket before the unis notice and walk over.
She gets kudos for noticing a clue, and then is too much in the way so she is shown out of the building.

The squad then meets up again at at different bar they had agreed upon the previous night, Zoe shares the bad news.
Scruffy made a touching memorial speech about how the world was better off without them, and to get him to stop Zoe showed them something she found at the crime scene, a Magician tarot card.
Margo touches the card, and it became hers and she just then _knew_ how it worked.
Everyone else touched it to also learn the rules/understand what she was babbling about, but knew she was the "owner".
Margo accidentally invokes the spell and then everyone had fries at dinner, despite not actually originally ordering them.

To close out the night the crew decides to go get a tarot reading from Chris' friend Imani.
She did a past/present/future reading for the group which was: the fool/inverted moon/9 of pentacles.
She tells a compelling story with this reading that seemed pretty relevant to the group ðŸ’–



## Plot ##

### Prologue (before 25 Jan 2038) ###

Zoe started her day with a case on her desk about a worker (**Maya Byrne**) who had filed a complaint against her former employer for the health issues her job caused her.
After reviewing the files, Zoe gave her a call and found out Maya couldn't walk, the workplace was always super, super rushed, and her previous boss there was named **Vincent Hall**.
Having come up pretty dry on details from Maya, Zoe decieded to do her job and research the shit out of _Obelisk_ the horrible employer.
The startup was in stealth mode so mostly all there was publicly was a shim site with reasonably good typography.
Looking a bit deeper in goverment records Zoe found some missing files for some applications/permits which she could get them on but was super minor.
Finally managed to find a liquor licence permit for a holding related in a paper trail to Obelisk.
It was to be held at the Lunar room at the Eclipse Hotel at 4th and Columbia on the 84th floor.
Apparently there was a party on Jan 25 that she needed to crash.

Now given she didn't have an invite to the party, Zoe needed an in.
Given the venue was fancy AF she decided to go to the fanciest bar she knew and try to find someone with an invite.
After some very expensive cocktails, she manages to hear a woman **Catalina** who was a start-up founder and complaining she didn't have the appropriate "arm candy" to take to the party.
Catalina runs a company that makes brain bran, an individually customized cereal for brain function.
Zoe grabs drinks for Catalina and her friend and turns on the charm, offering some suggestions for cap hill boutiques that Catalina could use to find what she needed to wear (Zoe knew what she ment, but was going for cute).
After a very successful seduction, Zoe has a date and an invite to the party.

### 25 Jan 2038: At the Lunar Room ###

Zoe serves Catalina's purposes well, and they both look stunning in emerald and gold gowns respectively.
They get their fancy mezcals as well as a survey of other people at the party: 

- Joyce Bennett (surveillence stuff?),
- Vincent Hill: Catalina said "he didn't know which way the wind was blowing",
- Jake Wood: 2nd time founder analytical fashion and boutiques, custom programmed pieces
- Valfreya: The funder of all of he projects here tonight CEO of Pandora Holdings, no one seems to talk to her.

Valfreya opens the talks section for the year 38 kickoff and has Sam (Margo's boss) to talk, and then Catalina went next.
Valfreya esp called out she was happy Vincent Hall of Obelisk could join.
After the speeches, Zoe tries to go talk to Vincent but he was talking to Valfreya and get slapped... hard.
Zoe overheard him telling her he is a magician and told her the inner inscription of a bracelet she was wearing.
Vincent was escorted out and then the party wound down.

After going outside, Zoe sees Margo following Vincent who was attacking Scruffy.
A long chase ensues, and completly winded Zoe is the last to catch up to Scruffy and Margo as Vincent and his assistant make away into the night.
Zoe called the cops but unclear if anyone came.
A moment later, Chris comes by on his way home and we all go to a bar Chris and Zoe know to process what in the hell just happened.
