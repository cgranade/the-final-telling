What secrets hide in the dreams of a dead city that has yet to note its own demise? What dread do we bury under layers of waking nightmares, beneath more tractable and familiar horrors? What misdeeds do we ignore in the sunlight while we live in the shade afforded by the profane landscapes of steel and glass that surrounds, embraces, and suffocates us? Today, we begin to lay all bare, for the die is cast. What is seen will not be unseen.
